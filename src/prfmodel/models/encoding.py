    """
    Encode a population receptive field model response with a stimulus design.

    Multiplies a stimulus design with a model response along the
    stimulus dimensions and sums over them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    response : Tensor
        The population receptive field model response. The first dimension corresponds to the number of batches.
        Additional dimensions correspond to the stimulus dimensions.
    design : Tensor
        The stimulus design containing the stimulus value in one or more dimensions over different time frames.
        The first axis is assumed to be time frames. Additional axes represent stimulus dimensions.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        The stimulus encoded model response with two dimensions.
        The first dimension is the batch dimension, the second dimension is time frames.

    Raises
    ------
    ResponseDesignShapeError
        If the shape of the model response and the stimulus design do not match.

    Examples
    --------
    Encode a 1D model response:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> num_batches = 3
    >>> num_frames = 10
    >>> height = 5
    >>> # Create a dummy stimulus design
    >>> design = np.ones((num_frames, height))
    >>> # Create a dummy model response that varies with the height of a stimulus grid
    >>> resp = np.ones((num_batches, height)) * np.expand_dims(np.sin(np.arange(height)), 0)
    >>> print(resp.shape) # (num_batches, height)
    (3, 5)
    >>> resp_encoded = encode_prf_response(resp, design)
    >>> print(resp_encoded.shape) (num_batches, num_frames)
    (3, 10)

    Encode a 2D model response:

    >>> # Add width dimension
    >>> width = 4
    >>> # Create a dummy stimulus design
    >>> design = np.ones((num_frames, height, width))
    >>> # Create a dummy model response that varies with the width of a stimulus grid
    >>> resp = np.ones((num_batches, height, width)) * np.expand_dims(np.sin(np.arange(width)), (0, 1))
